Software engineering course work at Vilnius Univesity.

Development and analysis of a real-time game agent using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for a Bomberman-inspired game. The agent demonstrates limited success, excelling at bomb avoidance but struggling with forward progression due to conservative decision-making influenced by the reward system.
